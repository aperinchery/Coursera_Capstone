### 1. _A description of the problem and a discussion of the background_ 

Seattle is a bustling, sprawling metropolitan city with engineers and developers and start up founders in hordes starting their morning with coffee. After all, Seattle is the birthplace of one of the most ubiquitous coffee shops in the US: Starbucks. Does it have room for one more coffee shop? With a population of over three-quarters of a million, I certainly think so, and so do mobs of caffeine-deprived workers and Starbucks alike. Imagine you are on the planning committee for the placement of the next Starbucks: Where should it be built? Where is the market saturated? Where is there a need for another coffee shop? 


### 2. _A description of the data and how it will be used to solve the problem._

I will use Foursquare Venue Data to identify where the market is most saturated with coffee shops and where there might be room for another coffee shop. Areas with fewer than 10 venues will be excluded from the analysis (as on inspection, these are often areas that are largely parks or low population areas). I will also rank the venues in each neighborhood by most popular venues. For example, a neighborhood where the three most popular venues are a restaurant, yoga studio and book store very likely has room for another coffee shop. A neighborhood where the most popular venues are coffee shops, bistros and cafes may not. It is with these criteria that I will determine the best neighborhood to establish a new coffee shop.
